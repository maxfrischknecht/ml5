# Transfer Learning

* Use someone elses model (retrain it) and expand it with your individual images.
* The machine only learns about the set of pixles you show it to them. (e.g. everything a human holds, the machine sees as celphone because there are so many of that type)

* Ml5 uses the [MobileNet Model](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/slim/nets/mobilenet_v1.md), it uses a [Neural Network](../neural_networks/README.md)
